We analyzed 1.688 satellite DNA in several different ways to make sure our analysis is robust. Please see detailed description in MATERIAL AND METHODS.

1) Files with suffix "_subfamily"
Analysis method: each 1.688 subfamily analyzed separately 

2) Files with suffix "_combined"
Analysis method: all 1.688 subfamilies combining into a single category named 1.688

3) Files with suffix "_each_locus"
Analysis method: each 1.688 heterochromatic locus analyzed separately with uniquely mapped reads or all mapped reads
